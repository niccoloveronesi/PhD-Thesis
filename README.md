Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 have been updated.

In both cases the changes do not concern our datasets, our analysis, or our results.
They consist into minor changes in the way the results are presented.

Chapter 4 now contains the version of the paper after the first iteration of the review process.
Chapter 5 now contains the version of the paper submitted on arXiv and to MNRAS.

2024.07.04:

Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 contain papers already published on the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS).
Chapter 4 contains a paper that is already publically available of arXiv and is currently under review by the journal MNRAS.
Chapter 5 contains a complete version of a paper that will be made public on arXiv and submitted to MNRAS in the next weeks.

When an updated version of Chapter 4 and/or of Chapter 5 will be completed, the committee will be notified of this.
It would be appreciated the updated versions could be considered as the ones to be finally approved.
